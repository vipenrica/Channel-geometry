# Channel-geometry

Here you can find the model and data presented in the paper Equilibrium of self-formed, single-thread, sand-bed rivers, which will be hopefuly published soon in Geophysical Research Letters. The authors are Enrica Viparelli and Esther Eke.

For more information you can read the paper, the supplementary material, the description in the excel files and you can also contact Enrica at viparell@cec.sc.edu.

In this repository you find two files:

1) Equilibrium_calculator.xlsm, an excel file with embedded macro (most calculations are done in the worksheets) that you can use to compute the equilibrium channel goemetry of a single thread, sand bed river.

2) Equilibrium_results.xlsx with the model results presented in the manuuscript.

These excel files should also be available from the Geophysical Research Letters website.
